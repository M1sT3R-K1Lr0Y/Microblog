Depression sucks.

It's a hell of an opening line for a microblog, isn't it?

Welcome to the darkest recesses of my mind, reader.  The side of me that most people don't see regardless if it's in meatspace or on the other side of the screen.  The side of me where I go deep into the shadows and dredge up the most hideous of secrets, the most damaging self-remarks, and deliberately make myself vulnerable.  Raw, uncut, unfiltered, and uncensored.  With luck, this won't be pulled down by the powers-that-be.

Why, you ask?  So you could find solace in my words.  Take refuge in my knowledge.  And hopefully, learn from my mistakes and failures so you don't repeat them.

Right, so off we go.  I'll do my best to post when I can given my hectic, chaotic schedule.  Who knows, maybe I can do this full time once I'm able to retire from my illustrious career in infosec, since I've already been labeled as a "failure" by at least a half-dozen "content creators" or more on Twitch, YouTube, and Kick.  Dare I call them out?  I could, although I'm sure they'll either deny they ever called me as such, or, threaten me with legal action because I've "defamed" them.  For all I care, those big names can rightfully go fuck themselves.  Same with everyone whom I've invested my time and money in and watch them grow, but never gave anything in return except a basic "fuck you" and leave me in the dust.

Yes, I've heard it all before - I just need to invest more time in streaming.  Short answer is, I can't.  Not with my current situation.  Apart from working full time, I do have a family that's falling apart.  Read on.

Wait, am I married?  Short answer is "it's complicated", but the more correct answer is that marriage is more than just a piece of paper that gets signed along with a ring on the finger.  It's also a *commitment* and a *covenant*.  Explain that, you ask.  Sure.  The commitment is a promise to each other; "for better or for worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do us part."  The covenant is a bit trickier; basically where both persons agree to work out issues as they arise, that their bodies are for each other and no one else, and to stay true to each other.  Sure, I'm well aware that some couples are into "open marriages", but that's not for me.  Not that I would ever knock a married couple who agreed to have an open marriage - they can have at it, but from my perspective it leads to far too many complications down the road.  Especially if one believes very strongly in monogamous relationships, and that includes yours truly.

The TLDR answer is this: the commitment and convenant between myself and my child's mother was broken a very long time ago.  Yes, we still live together under the same roof; yes, she still has my last name; but the love between us grew cold.  Yes, we've tried counseling.  Didn't help.  Our child was meant to heal the breach between us, but unfortunately he's become a pawn in the game which is what I never wanted.  And to be at each other's throats almost every day only makes my mental state worse, and knowing that our child is caught in the middle doesn't help.

Have I contemplated divorce?  At least once, but to hear her threaten it on more than one occasion has set me on edge.  I know all too well that fathers almost always get screwed over in family court, and I really don't want to be another statistic or "cash cow" when my soon-to-be-ex gives her sob story to the judge about how her home-based business has faltered no thanks to me, she can't obtain a full-time job because of her age and disability, and makes the ludicrous claim of how I'm a danger to "her child".  From my point of view, it's bullshit.  She admitted to me during the middle of one of our many heated arguments a few years ago that her goal was to "make enough money at her business so she can kick my ass to the curb."  Do I deserve it?  From her point of view, yes.  From her parents' point of view, yes.  From her brother's point of view, yes.  They all have seen me as a failure because I "can't hold down a steady job for more than eighteen months on average" and "I'm unable to manage my finances".  Oh, and I've also been accused by her of keeping her away from her friends, her church life, yadda yadda yadda because I can't come up with the down payment to get her a modified mobility van.  All in spite of my best efforts to prove otherwise.

Am I openly trashing her here?  Not one time have I addressed her by a derogatory term.  Divulging what goes on in my own only helps me to get this off my chest and out of my head, and - as I said before - for you, the reader, to learn from my mistakes and failures so you don't repeat them.  I'm not saying that marriage sucks, but what I am saying is that understand marriage requires both a lifelong commitment and a daily investment.  It's also very much a two-way street.

What do I fear the most?  Losing my child to her and her family.  Being told by the family law judge that I not only don't have primary custody (or shared custody) and I'm on the hook for alimony and child support.  Being told by the judge that I'm only entitled to supervised visitation once a month for a couple of hours - if that - and I also cannot leave the State in which I currently reside.  My only option at this point is to heed the advice of a close friend who passed away a few years ago and to petition the court for a child advocate.  For those not familiar, it's a neutral third-party who monitors a child's environment in both parents' homes and how others treat said child - then reports that information back to the court.  It's often used to determine if the custody needs to be changed; i.e. from primary to shared, or in some cases, primary to sole custody with visitation rights.  I wouldn't be surprised if my child's mother and her family protest this request, but it's the only tool I have in my arsenal to get somewhat of a fair shake in court.

Will I lose friendships over this sudden revelation?  Probably.  But if I do, were those other people ever truly friends with me in the first place, or were they only friends with me over the fact I donated or gifted subs to them?  Will I be accused of being a "pretender"?  Perhaps.  Then again, had they been paying attention to my Instagram posts, they probably would have guessed that I was struggling with some personal issues regarding my child and his mother for quite some time now, and it's only now that I decided to reveal everything.  From my perspective, it will be up to them to extend the proverbial olive branch, not me, without any conditions or restrictions.

One can only hope, and I don't have much of it left.
