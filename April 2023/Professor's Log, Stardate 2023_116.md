"First to 10K subs on Kick."

While every bit of congratulations are in order to that streamer, I find that somewhat depressing.  Why, you ask?  Is it jealousy?  Is it bitterness?

Perhaps it's a bit of both.  Sure, that streamer worked their ass off (I would say literally but then again that would be a rather humorous albeit gross sight to behold) to get to 10,000 subscribers in a month, making them the top streamer on the platform.  From what little I know, that person has spent countless hours building up a viable, if not somewhat profitable, presence as a full-time content creator.  Put in the time and effort, and voila!  Reach the right audience and you're the next Internet sensation.  Sure, I know quite a few streamers who have worked hard to reach 10,000 *followers*, but they're all mostly females.  It's a hard reality: sex sells.  Show off a little skin, put on a little makeup, and you're raking in the views.  Put up an OnlyFans or Fansly page, don't show off your entire body (or do), and you're making a decent amount of cash with each PPV and livestream.

Where does that leave me, I wonder?  Someone who is approaching fifty years of age, a little overweight, isn't all that attractive, doesn't play first-person shooters...

Oh, I know, let's start the list of reasons why I'm *not* a successful streamer.  I'm sure someone will eventually call me out and say they're "excuses", but as the song goes, "You'll stumble in my footsteps, keep the same appointments I've kept, if you try walking in my shoes."

- According to many Millenials and Gen Z kids, I'm either a "boomer" or "ancient".  If my calculations are correct, the majority of viewers who watch livestreams typically fall in the 18-25 age category, followed by the 26-33 range.  They don't want to watch a late-40-something on camera unless he's doing something that's never been tried before or is streaming "IRL" or "in-real-life".
- I'm not attractive.  I'm balding (which is why I completely shave my head), have a salt-and-pepper beard (which I'm told is ugly), and I'm not in the best physical shape.
- I hear the younger ladies say they "stan for dad bods" but I don't buy that logic at *all*.
- I don't play first-person shooters because well, I suck at them.
- Most people find games that aren't in the FPS category boring as fuck.  Same goes for anything that isn't multiplayer and/or fast-paced.
- I wear reading glasses because my eyes aren't what they used to be.  I also don't wear contacts.
- I could point out the obvious that I lack the right equipment but that would be bordering on sexism according to feminists and those with feminist leanings, so I won't go there.  Although I know for a *fact* that sex sells.
- I don't have the right personality.  I'm not loud, boisterous, nor do I pretend to lose my shit on camera.
- As I mentioned in my last post, I have a family although it's somewhat broken.  Yes, I have a child who looks up to me.  Yes, he and I stream once a week playing Raft.  But it doesn't attract a whole lot of viewers, either.
- I don't stream full-time, nor do I stream more than two days a week with my current schedule.  I work full-time and due to the nature of my work, I can't show that on camera.  There's a dcoument called a "non-disclosure agreement" that I signed.  Also, my evenings consist of cooking, cleaning, and spending time with my child unless I'm working on a project.
- I can't livestream from hackercons, period.  Not only would I need to obtain permission from the organizers, I also would need to obtain permission from anyone who might appear on-camera with me.  Livestreaming talks and workshops from my phone are verboten.  Also, I run the risk of having my livestream hijacked by an attendee or other person.

Oh, and let's not forget, not *every* streamer is willing to give back to those who are still struggling to make it on their own, including yours truly. Other than a "go follow so-and-so" it should be "here's why you should follow this person and why" then present clips of what *they* deem as "interesting content".

Not that I see that happening to me anytime soon, but eh.  Perhaps one day when I'm no longer around, people will eventually forget who I was.  And that's okay by me.  Because I have a legacy that's already been passed down. And when my child comes of age and has a family of his own, he will tell his children and potentially grandchildren about a man who once called himself "the Professor", and everything he tried to do to make a positive impact in the lives of many despite of their ungrateful natures.
