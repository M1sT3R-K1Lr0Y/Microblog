Today I decided to break the silence and returned to social media.  Was it the right decision?  Only God knows for sure, and I'm not going to pretend I'm on His level nor above it.

Surprisingly I had a few people in the streamer community all try to reach out to me, and to be honest it was somewhat touching to know that there are still people in this world whom I've never met genuinely care about my well-being.  Am I grateful, sure.

Too bad that not *everyone* I know, whether in person or on the other side of the screen, are like that.  I certainly can't change them, so I suppose I'll have to let them be for now.

As I sit here and type this post during the remainder of my lunch break, I'm listening to the sound of rain.  But it's not a depressing sound by any means.  No, it's more of a soothing comfort to me, to remind me that there are times that my spirit and my soul are in need of refreshing, and it's just good to take an extended break from the madness every once in a while.

I'll close out this post with a link to "Rain" by Jupiter.  Dreamy synthpop at it's best.  I'll see about posting up the lyrics later.
